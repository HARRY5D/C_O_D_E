    "## Objectives:\n",
    "1. Load and preprocess SMS datasets\n",
    "2. Compare multiple model architectures (LSTM, GRU, CNN-LSTM)\n",
    "3. Select the best performing model\n",
    "4. Convert to TensorFlow Lite format\n",
    "5. Comprehensive testing and validation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Sources:\n",
    "- `spam_texts.csv` - SMS messages with labels\n",
    "- `sms_phishing.xlsx` - Additional phishing message data"
